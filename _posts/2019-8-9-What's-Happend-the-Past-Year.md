## Mentality Before the Bootcamp and Background

If you don't know, I started my 'professional' career endeavors pursuing a career in the trades. 
I won't bore anyone with details. Well, maybe in a later post. I started in industrial maintenance. I didn't like factories and started working in the solar field as an apprentice electrician. I didn't like having to drive everywhere with no reimbursement nor concern for how I would get to the job site. I did like my boss, though. 
Regardless, I quit all of those jobs. Throughout that time I studied front-end related technologies on the side. 
This was not a serious thing and the resources I utilized included The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, etc. 
All of those sites are free and useful. My previous posts go over my move into a statically typed language and the resources 
I used for learning that technology. Truth be told, I wasn't regimented nor disciplined enough to exceed in my original self-taught endeavors. 
Counter-Strike and other video games took over and I was working random jobs just trying to keep my parents and grandparents from thinking 
I was a lazy slob. Which I was...

Despite the laziness, I was pretty regimented with my learning. I was consumed with idea that I could make it in tech. I could find a career that I would like. A job that I could tolerate. Tech had been this ideal career that would fulfill all my wants and desires. Through a bit of luck and not a lot of applications I found a company that would pay me to go to training, train me, and then contract me out. I decided to take the leap and move eight hours away from my safe haven in Kentucky.

## The Bootcamp
I don't want to touch on the company/boot camp that I went through. It worked for me - and I don't want any legal fallback. 
I can say that my housing was cheap. I got paid minimum wage while going through the 12-week course. I was supplied with an amazing job search team. I interviewed once and got hired by a Fortune 500 Company in the financial industry. The 12-week course was the most challenging thing I've done prior. It was intellectually rigorous. It was socially stimulating. The boot camp improved so many aspects of my life that I couldn't have done without the amazing support of the company and my peers. I believe boot camps will and do excel 
for those reasons.

I've never lived with roommates. Before the boot camp, I lived in a basement all by myself. The boot camp was my first foray into roommates. 
I got put into housing with 5 others in a 3 bedroom apartment. This apartment had issues, but the major benefit was it was walkable to work and the grocery. A place walkable to work and groceries is one of the secrets to happiness for me personally. I met slobs. People who didn't do their dishes. People who didn't have acceptable hygiene standards. In contrast, I met some of the most well-read individuals. Inspiring people who were much more intelligent than me. This might've not been an intended effect of the boot camp. However, the interpersonal skills gained will benefit me well into the future. The friendships I developed have been the most fulfilling I've had so far in this short life of mine.

The boot camp itself was made up of a 12-week course covering a Java track with some focus on microservices. Going into the boot camp, I only knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've dabbled in Ruby, C#, and Python. But, again only dabbled with no real understanding. The boot camp was vigorous and intense. It felt like finals week in college for every single week. I used Anki, worked on projects, and went to the course for a total of 60+ hours working solely towards learning this software development thing. In the end, it paid off.

## After the Bootcamp
I can honestly say I would not have a job in software development without the company I work for. I went from front-end technologists to a full-stack developer. I know of the JavaEE technologies abstracted as low as servlets and JDBC up to Spring Boot and Hibernate. My knowledge of databases improved from nil to junior level. I learned about DevOps principles. I learned how to work well with a team. I learned that if I commit to something - I can accomplish it. I look forward to my future in the financial industry.
