I'm just learning to solve intriguing puzzles and seemingly complex ideas and trying to make them simple.  

### Just a Little Bit More About Me

I first started to get interested in programming when I was 18 (2015). Through research on reddit I found different learning resources from codecademy to FreeCodeCamp. FreeCodeCamp was the most interesting to me as solving real problems with user stories tested me on a daily basis. I remember accessing the Twitch API and building a project for FreeCodeCamp using the Twitch API. What an incredibly frustrating experience for someone new to programming. 

The continually frustrating moments taught me habits I continue to rely on even outside of programming: dividing problems into smaller problems, VIGORIOUS Google searching, and empathy for end-users and their experience.
